# [MVA] SinGAN-for-image-Denoising
This Work was done by me Wassim BOUATAY and Amrou CHOUCHENE
This project was part of the MVA course: Object Recgonition and Computer Vision.

The goal of the project is to apply SinGAN, which normally aims to generate new samples, for image denoising. Our work beats BM3D and FFDnet in terms of PSNR.
